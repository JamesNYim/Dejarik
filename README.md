## Creative Tilt
The goal of this game was to recreate a board game seen in the Star Wars Universe.

I focused more on the technical aspect of game design in order to simulate what a board game would be like on a computer. I used object oriented techniques to make things easier and more organized. A big design aspect I used was inheritence. This allowed me to easily organize multiple objects that share common attributes and functions. It also allows me to scale easily adding new objects and attributes.

The art in my opinion is not the greatest, but I am not the most artistic person. This is the most art I have ever done for a project so far. I learned alot about what makes good animation and design. I really enjoyed making the assets.
